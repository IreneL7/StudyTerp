<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project üìò

Study Terp is a study buddy matchmaker for students at the University of Maryland. Through this revolutionary social 
study platform, students are matched with study buddies based on classes, schedules, majors/minors, study habits,
and overall compatibility. Study Terp aims to foster a supportive and collaborative learning environment on demand 
for every student by connecting them with like-minded peers. Say goodbye to solo study struggles and hello to a brighter,
more interactive academic journey. Your perfect study buddy is just a click away!
